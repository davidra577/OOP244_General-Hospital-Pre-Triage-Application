Final Assignment Reflection OOP244
Date: Dec 2nd 2020

My overall experience with OOP244 was very positive.
Professor Huang did an exceptional job teaching the class on various topics of OOP244 and C++ programming.
The lecture slide summarized and covered all topics very well.
The professor also showed various example of sample codes of the relevant topic. This has helped to enforce materials we covered during the lecture.
The quiz reflected on what we have learned during the lecture. It included various forms of questions such as coding a function and multiple choice based on theories.

I liked how the workshops and the final project were creating programs that could potentially be used in a work-environment.
For example, the final project was about hospital registeration and admittance. 
This could be correlated to real world scenario (hospital) as we are currently in a pandemic.
The final project included and covered all materials that we have learned. 
By having milestones, it made us easier to build a complete program. The milestones were checkpoints as there were various tester files to test out portion of the program.
During the final milestone, it forced us to integrate multiple files and test various scenarios to make sure that our program was working as intended.

One thing that was difficiult was the instruction of the final assigment, specifically the last milestone.
I felt that the instructions of the final milestone were vague and not clear. There were couple steps missing in the instruction.
Even though I have completed in time, It felt we had very little time to complete them as we had final exams and projects from other courses.
I think the students would have found extremely helpful if they have gotten extra time or extension of the final milestone as well as midterm.
